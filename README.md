## Inspiration

My wife is an OBGYN trying to stay up-to-date on papers. Initially downloading them all to review and study offline and at her own pace was incredily time consumings, so I basically wrote this code as to serve as a "download all" button. As these acadamic papers are behind a paywall for a reason, I am not uploading the PDFs here.
